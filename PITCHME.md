## Why macOS for Web Development?

@ul
- Nice to look at hardware making one feel special
  - 10 years age
- pretty (and) stable operating system
- Good/mostly consistent design language
- Good tools
- BSD core for a very similar environment than on the servers running Linux
  - which sometime is pretty different
- homebrew

## Differences macOS/Windows

@ul
- Command diffences: `Cmd` vs. `Crtl`
- Path separator: `/` vs. `\`
- Line endings: `lf` vs. `crlf`
- Tools:
  - `ls` vs. `dir`
  - `rm` vs. `del`
  - `cp` vs. `(x)copy`
  - ...
- and then...

# Things not so nice in WSL...

@ul
- The difference in paths still remains
- Need to install (and maintain) tools twice @note[windows ides rely on windows tools]

- git on windows/wsl can make your life hell @note[need to force eol to lf and filemode to false]
