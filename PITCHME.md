## Why did macOS become the goto place for Web Development?

@ul
- Nice to look at hardware making one feel special
  - 10 years ago
- pretty (and) stable operating system
- Good/mostly consistent design language
- Good tools
- BSD core for a very similar environment than on the servers running Linux
