## Why macOS for Web Development?

@ul
- Nice to look at hardware making one feel special
  - 10 years ago ��
- pretty (and) stable operating system
- Good/mostly consistent design language
- Good tools
- BSD core for a very similar environment than on the servers running Linux
  - which sometime is pretty different
- homebrew

## Why macOS is not for Web Development

@ul
- Apple decides everything, wants to close down system even more
- Very expensive hardware
  - touchbar
  - butterfly keyboards
  - Donglehell

## Enter WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux)
